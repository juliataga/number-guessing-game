# Number Guessing Game

A simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range.

## How it Works

- The player inputs a lower and upper bound.
- The game randomly selects a number in that range.
- The player has 7 chances to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the game gives a hint:
  - Too high
  - Too low
  - Correct
- If all attempts are used without guessing correctly, the correct number is revealed.
